# Exercise 1:
# Print the following output in one line of code:
# sentence="Hello World\n"
# print(sentence*4)

# Exercise 2:
# Write code that calculates the result of: (99^3)*8 (meaning 99 to the power of 3, times 8).
# calculation=(99^3)*8
# print(calculation)

# 5<3 false
# 3==3 true
# 3=="3" false
# "3">3 false
# "Hello" == "hello" true

# Exercise 4:
# Create a variable called computer_brand which value is the brand name of your computer.
# Using the computer_brand variable print a sentence that states the following: "I have a <computer_brand> computer".
# computer_brand="Asus"
# print(f"my computer brand is {computer_brand}")

# Exercise 5:
# Create a variable called name, and set it’s value to your name.
# Create a variable called age, and set it’s value to your age.
# Create a variable called shoe_size, and set it’s value to your shoe size.
# Create a variable called info and set it’s value to an interesting sentence about yourself. The sentence must contain all the variables created in parts 1, 2 and 3.
# Have your code print the info message.
# Run your code
# name="Samuel"
# age=31
# shoes_size=41
# info="I love israeli music"
# sentence= f"my name is {name}. I'm {age}. My shoes are {shoes_size} and {info}."
# print(sentence)

# Exercise 6:
# Create two variables, a and b.
# Each variable value should be a number.
# If a is bigger then b, have your code print Hello World.
# a=6
# b=7
# if a>b:
#     print("Hello World")
# else:
#     print("b is greater and a")

# Exercise 8:
# Write code that asks the user for their name and determines whether or not you have the same name, print out a funny message based on the outcome.
# my_name="Samuel"
# name=input("Enter your name: ")
# if name==my_name:
#     print("Yeah! We have the same name!")
# else:
#     print("we don't not have the same name.")

# Exercise 9:
# Write code that will ask the user for their height in centimeters.
# If they are over 145cm print a message that states they are tall enough to ride.
# If they are not tall enough print a message that says they need to grow some more to ride.
# user_height=int(input("Enter you height in cm: "))
# height_ride=145
# if user_height<height_ride:
#     # print("You are not tall enough to ride")
# else:
#     # print("You can ride")
